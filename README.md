Set up and print simple double sided flash cards, business cards, etc, with images &amp; rich text support

This was a quick and dirty project (that works with chrome and my printer!) to print double sided flash cards, because I wasn't happy with anything on the first page of google for this purpose.  It was also a good excuse to learn a tiny bit about Svelte.  If you want another feature or to add something, feel free to shoot me a pull request.  Or file an issue, but no promises there.

It is hosted at: https://sammmmm.github.io/FlashCardPrinter/ and https://flashcardprinter.swc.io/

Known issues: if you have a border on both sides of the card, they don't quite line up, which also means the cards aren quite centered to one another.  Not a huge deal with a little bit of a margin on the card edge, also not sure if it's my printer or an actual css problem of some sort with the centering of the cards on the page (if they're off-center, it'll be off center in the other direction when flipped for the backside).
