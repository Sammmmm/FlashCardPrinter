Set up and print simple double sided flash cards, business cards, etc, with images &amp; rich text support

This was a quick and dirty project (that works with chrome and my printer!) to print double sided flash cards, because I wasn't happy with anything on the first page of google for this purpose.  It was also a good excuse to learn a tiny bit about Svelte.  If you want another feature or to add something, feel free to shoot me a pull request.  Or file an issue, but no promises there.
